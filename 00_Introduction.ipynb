    "\n",
    "A time series is a series of data points, ordered in time. For complex systems, each data point will likely be **multivariate**, meaning there are multiple variables for each data point.  Examples of data sets with multivariate time series data are financial markets, air quality measurement, and health records.  In each case, the goal is to predict one of the variable values, such as a stock price, pollutant level, or patient outcome, based on the sequential dependence of past data.  \n",
